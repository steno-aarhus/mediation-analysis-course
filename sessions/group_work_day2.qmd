# Day 2: Group work

::: callout-note
## Objective of this session

In this session, We will get hands on practice using the Framingham
dataset. You will conduct a proper causal mediation analysis,
considering:

-   Conduct causal mediation analyses with exposure induced
    mediator-outcome confounder or multiple mediators
-   Conduct sensitivity analyses
-   Report the results following the guidelines
:::

We will continue working with the obesity and cardiovascular disease
example.

First, reflect on the group work from yesterday and discuss the
following questions with your group members:

-   Review the assumptions of causal mediation, and discuss the
    robustness of your estimates
-   Are there other mediators than systolic blood pressure?
-   Are there interactions between obesity and the mediators?

Re-conduct the mediation analysis and address the discussion points. You
can either use the **mediation** package or **CMAverse** package.

1.  Re-do the DAG, and investigate the potential pathways

2.  Perform a causal mediation analysis

3.  Conduct a sensitivity analyses and discuss the results

4.  Write a short report of your mediation models
