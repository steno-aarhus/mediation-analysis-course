# Motivation for mediation analysis

<!-- Omar 30 min -->

Basic, clinical and epidemiological research are often interested in
whether a specific intervention has an effect on a disease. Once that
has been established, the natural subsequent question is *why* the
intervention had an effect? **What was the mechanism?**
[@vanderweele_mediation_2016].

Mediation analysis can, if used correctly, answer such questions.
However, this is unfortunately rarely the case because the methods are
used incorrectly. A recent systematic review of the reporting quality of
studies applying mediation analysis showed that most of the studies had
incomplete reporting [@rrn_systematic_2022]. This impacts both
reproducibility and translation into practice.

Alongside the applied research, the methodological framework for
conducting mediation analysis has also evolved rapidly in recent years.
Unfortunately, most applied examples have not caught up with this
progression in methodology. In fact, a scoping review found that between
2015 to 2019 only 29.3% of studies using mediation analysis used modern
mediation analysis methods [@rijnhart_mediation_2021].

## Exercise: Understanding different study designs (30 min)

You will now be placed in different groups and read selected sections of
different mediation analyses within different study designs. You have 15
min to complete the task. Then, each group will briefly present their
paper, the approach used and what they thought about it.

### Group 1: Intervention study a

Paper: [Shoer et al.
2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41042-x)

-   read the abstract
-   read section 'Mediation analysis' under 'Methods'
-   read section 'The microbiome mediates the dietâ€™s effect' under
    'Results'
-   try to understand Fig. 4.

Task: explain the overall study and the mediation analysis. What does
the results imply?

### Group 2: Intervention study b

Paper: [Johansen et al.
2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-020-05249-7)

-   read the abstract
-   read from "Single mediation analysis" under 'Statistical analysis'
-   try to understand table 4
-   read from "To explore the role of weight loss in relation to beta
    cell function we performed single mediation analysis" under
    'Discussion'

Task: explain the overall study and the mediation analysis. What does
the results imply? How did the authors interpret the results? How do you
interpret the results?

### Group 3: Cohort study

Paper: [Wang et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-022-05692-8)

-   read the abstract
-   read from "To test whether an association between the metabolite
    profile score and risk of type 2 diabetes..." under 'Statistical
    analysis'
-   try to understand Fig. 4
-   read the conclusion

Task: explain the overall study and the mediation analysis. What does
the results imply? How did the authors interpret the results? How do you
interpret the results?

### Group 4: Cross-sectional study

Paper: [Shi et al.
2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08544-y)

-   read the abstract
-   they used a specific algorithm to identify mediation. You do not
    have to understand how it works. Simply note whether they adjusted
    for specific variables in their analysis (Hint: look in the methods
    section)
-   Read section 'Mediation by the gut microbial species Dialister
    invisus' under 'Results'

Task: explain the overall study design, what exposure, mediator and
outcomes were they interested in? Are their results causal?
