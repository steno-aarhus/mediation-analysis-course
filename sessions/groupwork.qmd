## Group work-day1 

**Day 1 Group Exercise (May 27)**

We will use Framingham dataset for this exercise.

*The overall aim of the cohort study is to estimate the average total effect (marginal treatment effect) of obesity on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).*

*Variable list for dataset 1:*

***socio** = socioeconomic status (SES) (binary: 0 = low SES, 1 = high SES)*

***smoke** = smoking status (binary: 0 = no prenatal smoking, 1 = prenatal smoking)*

***education***

***bmi** = body mass index (BMI) (continuous variable in kg/m^2^)*

*obesity (binary: 0=normal, 1=obesity)*

*CVD= (binary: 0=no, 1=yes).*

There are other variables in the dataset, please take a few minutes to explore the dataset. Before we start, let's think about the research question and draw a directed acyclic graphs. You can either draw by hand or use daggity (https://www.dagitty.net/).

[Address the following questions]{.underline}:

1.    Estimate the conditional treatment effect of obesity on the prevalence of CVD (conditional on SES, or other variables based on DAG).

2.    Estimate the relationship between obesity and blood pressure.

3.    Fit the outcome model, with obesity as exposure, and blood pressure as outcome.

4.    Calculate the direct effect and indirect effect using the product method and difference method, and compare results from the two approaches.

5.    Calculate the direct effect and indirect effect using the **mediation** package.

6.   Discuss the limitations of the traditional approach.
