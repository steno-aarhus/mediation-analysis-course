# Reporting guidelines

In this session we will use some time to understand the reporting
guidelines for mediation analysis as these are seldom used in practice.

## The overall course objective

-   Present results from mediation analysis according to the current
    mediation analysis reporting guidelines

## AGReMA checklist

Recent reviews on mediation analyses have suggested that the reporting
and documentation from studies were insufficient in the interpretation
of the results and for application in meta-analysis.

Based on this, a group of researchers have using a comprehensive
consensus method developed a reporting checklist @lee_guideline_2021.

There is both a long and a short form of this reporting checklist. The
long form should be used if the main aim of the paper is mediation
analysis. In many papers, mediation analysis is conducted as an extra
step. Therefore, the authors also developed a short form that should be
used in this situation.

### Long format

The list contains 25 items and in many ways resemble other reporting
checklists @fig-agrema-checklist.

What is worth highlighting is that the reasoning and rationale for even
conducting mediation analysis should be reported. Why do you believe
there is an association between A and Y and why do you think M is a
mediator.

They also emphasize that you should include a DAG that show your
assumptions. And you should critically consider whether you can fulfill
the causal assumptions before performing mediation analysis.

### Short format

The short list includes fewer items, but still emphasize key things to
report. See @fig-agrema-checklist-sf.

## Exercise

-   how many of the items are reported in the mediation analysis papers
    you reviewed in the beginning of the course?
-   what do you think are the most important things missing?
