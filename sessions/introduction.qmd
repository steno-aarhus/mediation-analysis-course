# Welcome to the course {#sec-welcome}
<!-- Daniel 15 min -->

Welcome to the course on Modern Mediation Analysis!

This is a 3-day course sponsored by the Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy. The course will take you through the realm of mediation analysis, starting with the traditional approach, then dive into causal mediation analysis and modern mediation analysis. Lastly, we will introduce a different approach more suitable for omics-type data taking a network analysis approach.

## Overall learning outcomes

::: callout-note
## The overall course objective

To provide participants with the knowledge, tools and skills to implement modern mediation analysis for investigation of disease mechanisms.

:::

The more specific learning outcomes include:

-	Explain the theoretical concepts and statistical methods regarding traditional and modern mediation analysis applied to basic, clinical and epidemiological research on diabetes and endocrine diseases.
-	Perform traditional and modern mediation analysis using R software.
- Present results from mediation analysis according to the current mediation analysis  reporting guidelines.
- Interpret results from mediation analysis and suggest relevant sensitivity analyses for mediation analyses
- Discuss the strengths, limitations and assumptions of traditional and modern mediation analysis

**The target audience:** 
PhD students and postdocs conducting research within the field of basic science, clinical, and epidemiological studies on diabetes and endocrinology, that are planning to conduct mediation analysis or that are interested in widening their analysis toolkit.

**Prerequisites**
Knowledge about linear and logistic regression and experience using R.

## Schedule
Over the 3 days we will combine lectures with code-along sessions, group work, discussions and networking activities.

# Motivation for mediation analysis - Omar (60 min)
<!-- Omar 60 min -->

Basic, clinical and epidemiological research are often interested in whether a specific intervention has an effect on a disease. Once that has been established, the natural subsequent question is *why* the intervention had an effect? **What was the mechanism?** [@vanderweele_mediation_2016].

Mediation analysis can, if used correctly, answer such questions. However, this is unfortunately rarely the case because the methods are used incorrectly. A recent systematic review of the reporting quality of studies applying mediation analysis showed that most of the studies had incomplete reporting [@rrn_systematic_2022]. This impacts both reproducibility and translation into practice. 

Alongside the applied research, the methodological framework for conducting mediation analysis has also evolved rapidly in recent years. Unfortunately, most applied examples have not caught up with this progression in methodology. In fact, a scoping review found that between 2015 to 2019 only 29.3% of studies using mediation analysis used modern mediation analysis methods [@rijnhart_mediation_2021].

## Exercise: Understanding different study designs (30 min)
You will now be placed in different groups and read selected sections of different mediation analyses within different study designs. You have 15 min to complete the task. Then, each group will briefly present their paper, the approach used and what they thought about it.

### Group 1: Intervention study a

Paper: [Shoer et al. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41042-x) 

- read the abstract
- read section 'Mediation analysis' under 'Methods'
- read section 'The microbiome mediates the dietâ€™s effect' under 'Results'
- try to understand Fig. 4.

Task: explain the overall study and the mediation analysis. What does the results imply? 

### Group 2: Intervention study b

Paper: [Johansen et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-020-05249-7) 

- read the abstract
- read from "Single mediation analysis" under 'Statistical analysis'
- try to understand table 4
- read from "To explore the role of weight loss in relation to beta cell function we performed single mediation analysis" under 'Discussion'

Task: explain the overall study and the mediation analysis. What does the results imply? How did the authors interpret the results? How do you interpret the results?

### Group 3: Cohort study

Paper: [Wang et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-022-05692-8) 

- read the abstract
- read from "To test whether an association between the metabolite profile score and risk of type 2 diabetes..." under 'Statistical analysis'
- try to understand Fig. 4
- read the conclusion 

Task: explain the overall study and the mediation analysis. What does the results imply? How did the authors interpret the results? How do you interpret the results?

### Group 4: Cross-sectional study

Paper: [Shi et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08544-y) 

- read the abstract
- they used a specific algorithm to identify mediation. You do not have to understand how it works. Simply note whether they adjusted for specific variables in their analysis (Hint: look in the methods section)
- Read section 'Mediation by the gut microbial species Dialister invisus' under 'Results'

Task: explain the overall study design, what exposure, mediator and outcomes were they interested in? Are their results causal?
