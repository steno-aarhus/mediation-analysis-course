Welcome to the course on Modern Mediation Analysis!

This is a 3-day course sponsored by the Danish Diabetes and Endocrine
Academy. The course will take you through the realm of mediation
analysis, starting with the traditional approach, then dive into causal
mediation analysis and modern mediation analysis. Lastly, we will
introduce a different approach more suitable for omics-type data taking
a network analysis approach.

Note, this is the first time we run this course. Thus, there will be
some mistakes here and there. Please let us know so we can improve for
next time.

## Overall learning outcomes

::: callout-note
## The overall course objective

To provide participants with the knowledge, tools and skills to
implement modern mediation analysis for investigation of disease
mechanisms.
:::

The more specific learning outcomes include:

-   **Explain** the theoretical concepts and statistical methods
    regarding traditional and modern mediation analysis applied to
    basic, clinical and epidemiological research on diabetes and
    endocrine diseases
-   **Perform** traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis using
    R software
-   **Present** results from mediation analysis according to the current
    mediation analysis reporting guidelines
-   **Interpret** results from mediation analysis and suggest relevant
    sensitivity analyses for mediation analyses
-   **Discuss** the strengths, limitations and assumptions of
    traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis

### The target audience

PhD students and postdocs conducting research within the field of basic
science, clinical, and epidemiological studies on diabetes and
endocrinology, that are planning to conduct mediation analysis or that
are interested in widening their analysis toolkit.

### Prerequisites

Knowledge about linear and logistic regression and experience using R.

## Schedule

Over the 3 days we will combine lectures with code-along sessions, group
work, discussions and networking activities.

<!-- notes: less time for estimation for day 2 -->

## Practical information

-   There will be served coffee and tea in the break and a sandwich for
    lunch
-   On day 1 in the afternoon, there will be a networking activity. We
    will do a speed-dating introduction to each other's research
    projects, whether you plan to use mediation analysis and what you
    hope to learn from this course.
-   On day 2 in the evening, we will all go for a dinner in the city of
    Aarhus. The dinner is a buffet at Food Club Aarhus, Aaboulevarden
    30, Aarhus C
-   We will have a social activity before the dinner. This is optional
    and all are also welcome to join the dinner later.
-   On day 3, the lecture on approaches for omics-type data, this
    lecture will be combined with a Steno Thursday Global, which will be
    open to all to attend and will be streamed online as well
-   If you are interested in more networking with the speakers and want
    to learn more about their research, there will be a networking
    session and a Precision Medicine Network meeting on Friday May 31.
    Please let us know, if you want to join ASAP.
-   Please be aware that the areas outside the lecture theater is a
    public space where people who go to the diabetes clinic also are. Be
    mindful of them.
