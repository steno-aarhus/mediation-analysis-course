1.  Read the learning objectives in @sec-learning-objectives
2.  Install the necessary programs in @sec-intall-r-packages
3.  Download the data or the repository in @sec-download-data
4.  Read the Code of Conduct @sec-code-of-conduct.

## Learning objectives {#sec-learning-objectives}

::: callout-note
## The overall course objective

To provide participants with the knowledge, tools and skills to
implement modern mediation analysis for investigation of disease
mechanisms.
:::

The more specific learning outcomes include:

-   Explain the theoretical concepts and statistical methods regarding
    traditional and modern mediation analysis applied to basic, clinical
    and epidemiological research on diabetes and endocrine diseases
-   Perform traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis using R
    software
-   Present results from mediation analysis according to the current
    mediation analysis reporting guidelines
-   Interpret results from mediation analysis and suggest relevant
    sensitivity analyses for mediation analyses
-   Discuss the strengths, limitations and assumptions of traditional,
    causal and modern mediation analysis

## Installing programs {#sec-intall-r-packages}

### Installing R

If you have not already done so, please download the latest version of R
for [Window](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or
[Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

If you have R, check the version.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| results: asis
R.Version()
```

If you have anything from 4.3.1 or later, it should be okay.

### Installing R packages

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("tidyverse")
pak::pkg_install("DiagrammeR")
pak::pkg_install("downlit")
pak::pkg_install("furrr")
pak::pkg_install("here")
pak::pkg_install("knitr")
pak::pkg_install("mediation")
pak::pkg_install("NetCoupler")
pak::pkg_install("rmarkdown")
pak::pkg_install("survival")
pak::pkg_install("xml2")
pak::pkg_install("here")
pak::pkg_install("BS1125/CMAverse")
```

If installation of a package does not work using the "pak" package, then
use:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| results: asis

#install.packages("name-of-package")

```

## Download the data {#sec-download-data}

You can follow all the teaching material on this website. For the
exercises, you will need to use the datasets we have created.

You can either download the entire repository (recommended) or simply
download the data from our github.

### Download repository

1.  Open a new session of R in RStudio. If you are in a project, go our
    of that project.
2.  Using RStudio's New Project menu item: "File -\> New Project -\>
    Version control -\> Git"
3.  Keeping RStudio open, open your browser and go to our
    [repository](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/mediation-analysis-course)
4.  Then, Click on the green "code" icon and copy-paste
    "https://github.com/steno-aarhus/mediation-analysis-course.git"
5.  Now go back to R and put in what you just copy-pasted under
    "Repository URL." You should also select where this project should.
6.  Click "create project" and you should now have all materials there.

### Download the data

If you want to only download the course data. You can go to here for the
Framingham data and here for the NHANES data. Click "download raw file"
in the top right corner.

## Code of conduct {#sec-code-of-conduct}

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://guides.rostools.org/conduct.html).
If you haven't read it, **read it now**. This course is a supportive and
safe environment for learning, so this Code of Conduct is important.
