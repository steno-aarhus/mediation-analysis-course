For the mediation analysis, this introduction targets the controlled direct effect, the indirect and direct effect as overall concepts. In the next sessions, we will dive further into additional estimands and decompositions of the effects.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Learning outcomes\n\n- Explain the theoretical concepts and statistical methods regarding causal mediation analysis\n-\tPerform causal mediation analysis using R software\n- Interpret results from causal mediation analysis\n\n:::\n\n## What is a cause?\n\nIn a way this can be very intuitive. If I press the switch, the light will come on. We use causal reasoning all the time. If I do A, then Y will happen. Some relationships we can define them to be deterministic. Doing A will always lead to Y. This is useful for our intuition but when we work with health outcomes it is more complicated.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Notation\nA = received treatment/intervention/exposure (e.g., 1 = intervention, 0 = no intervention)\n\nY = observed outcome (e.g., 1 = developed the outcome, 0 = no outcome) \n\n$Y^{a=1}$ = Counterfactual outcome under treatment a (i.e., the outcome had everyone, counter to the fact, recieved treatment a = 1)\n\n$Y^{a=0}$ = Counterfactual outcome under treatment a (i.e., the outcome had everyone, counter to the fact, recieved treatment a = 0)\n\n:::\n\n### Individual causal effect\nWhen investigating health outcomes, we would ideally want to know if **you** do X, then Y will happen. We could have a specific question:\n\n> Will eating more red meat give me higher blood glucose in 1 year?\n\nTo answer this question we would ideally have you consume more red meat over 1 year and measure your blood glucose levels. Then, we would turn back time, and make you eat something else over 1 year and then measure your blood glucose levels again. If there is a difference between your two outcomes, then we say there is a causal effect. \n\nBut we can never do this in the real world.\n\n### Average causal effect\nInstead, we can perform a randomized controlled trial. We now ask a slightly different question:\n\n> Will eating more red meat give adults higher blood glucose in 1 year?\n\nWe can randomely assigning one group to consume more red meat and the other group to consume more of something else over 1 year. Then we compare the average blood glucose levels after 1 year in each of the groups. If there is a difference, we could say there is an average causal effect.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Notation\nWe now modify the terms a little.\n\n$E[Y^{a=1}]$ the average counterfactual outcome, had all subjects in the population received treatment a = 1.\n\n$Pr[Y^{a=1}]$ the proportion of subjects that would have developed the outcome Y had all subjects in the population of interest received treatment a = 1.\n\n:::\n\n### Definition of a causal effect\nMore formally we can now define a causal effect (ref:Hernan2004): \n\n$E[Y^{a=1} = 1] - E[Y^{a=0} = 1] \\ne 0$\n\n### Code example: estimating causal effect\n\nTo get an idea of what is going on, we will simulate a simple dataset with an outcome Y, treatment A and a confounder W.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 1e6\nw <- rnorm(n)\na <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)\ny <- rnorm(n, w + a)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, we will run a linear regression model for the effect of the treatment on the outcome, adjusting for confounder w.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_y <- lm(y ~ a + w)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now use this model to predict the outcome, if **all** had received treatment = 1 and another prediction of the outcome had everyone not received treatment (A = 0).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npred_y1 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(a = 1, w = w))\npred_y0 <- predict(lm_y, newdata = data.frame(a = 0, w = w))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now get the causal effect, which is the average of the difference in the treatment effect in each group. Or put more formally E[Y^{a=1} = 1] - E[Y^{a=0} = 1]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(pred_y1 - pred_y0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> [1] 1.004496\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt turns out that this average causal effect is the same as the regression coefficient in the linear model.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(lm_y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = y ~ a + w)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n#> -5.1811 -0.6752  0.0012  0.6740  4.6204 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>              Estimate Std.

However, for more complicated situations, the regression-based approach fail. The causal intuition in the regression-based approach is also less clear.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Question\n\nWhy is there no difference between the linear regression coefficient and the predicted mean difference?\n\n:::\n\n## Association vs causation\n\nWhat makes it complicated to estimate a causal effect is that we cannot observe the outcome under different treatments.\n\nWhen we only have a subset of the outcomes, we have an association. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nIf we want to infer a causal effect (i.e., what would have happened, had everyone done A=1 vs A=0), we need three assumptions to be fulfilled:\n\n- Exchangeability\n- Consistency\n- Positivity\n\n### Exchangeability\nThe risk of the outcome in A = 1 would have been the same as the risk of the outcome in A = 0, had those in A = 1 received A = 0.\n\nThink about a randomized trial where you, by mistake, give the intervention to the other group. The effect should be the same as the one you would have observed had the groups been correct. \n\nWe can also have conditional exchangeability. The risk is similar in subsets of the population. That could be within the levels of a variable W (e.g., education).\n\n### Consistency\nThe treatments under comparison are well-defined and correspond to the versions of treatment observed in the data:\n\n- Precise definition of $Y^a$ via a\n- Link counterfactual outcomes with observed outcomes\n\n$Y^a = Y$ for every individual with A = a.\n\nThe observed outcome for all treated equals the outcome if they had received the treatment.\n\n### Positivity\nThe probability of receiving every value of treatment conditional on L is greater than zero. In other words, there must be a probability of being assigned to each treatment level.\n\nThink, if we donâ€™t have anyone with A = 0 among those with L=1 (e.g. long education), then we cannot estimate the conditional probability of the outcome.\n\n## A randomized controlled trial\nIn a randomized controlled trial these assumptions are often fulfilled given that the randomization is successful (i.e., have exchangeability and large enough groups), the treatment is clearly defined (consistency) and by design all have the possibility to be in either group (positivity).\n\nThese assumptions are much harder, let alone impossible, to verify in an observational study. That is why causation is more challenging in observational studies. \n\n## Importance of good research questions\nWhen we talk about causal effects, we often ask \"what if\"-questions and we can think of them in the context of a randomized controlled trial. \n\nA formal extension of this notion is the target trial framework. Here, one first specify the target trial, or referred to as the hypothetical interventions that one would have wanted to perform, to address a specific research question.\n\n## Directed Acyclic Graphs\nAnother method to graphically display your research question and your assumptions about your data is by using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DAGs are a simple and transparent way to identify and illustrate your assumptions about the causal relationships between variables in your dataset.\n\nA DAG contains nodes and arrows. It cannot be circular. Fig. 2 shows the different types of variables in a DAG and rules for paths (ref:Tennant2021). \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Causal mediation analysis\nCausal mediation analyses help you establish whether treatment _causes_ the outcome because it _causes_ the mediator. To do this, causal mediation seek to understand how the paths behave under circumstances different from the observed circumstances (e.g., interventions).\n\nCausal mediation analysis is an extension of the traditional approach by:\n- outlining all confounding assumptions needed\n- handling non-linearity and interaction\n- clearly defining estimands of interest\n\n## Confounding assumptions\nBy using DAGs, the assumptions about confounding are made much more explicit.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fig. 3. DAG under *no intermediate confounders* of the mediator-outcome relation affected by treatment](causal-mediation-analysis-introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn Fig 3. we can see that we not only have to take confounding between the treatment and outcome into account, but we also have to take mediator-outcome ($A \\leftarrow W \\rightarrow Y$) confounding into account.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Randomized controlled trials\n\nNote, even if you have a randomized controlled trial, you can have mediator-outcome confounding. This is because the mediator has not been randomized. \n\nConsequently, mediation analysis in randomized controlled trials also need to do adjustment of potential confounders and residual confounding cannot be ruled out. \n\n:::\n\nIn addition, we can have a more complicated situation where the treatment also impacts another mediator that is also a mediator-outcome confounder. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fig. 4. DAG under intermediate confounders of the mediator-outcome relation affected by treatment](causal-mediation-analysis-introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the DAG rules, we have a special problem that we cannot solve with traditional regression approaches. If we adjust for Z we open the backdoor path from $Z \\leftarrow W \\rightarrow Y$. We will work on how to solve this problem later in the course.  \n\n## Non-linearity and interactions\nNeither the product method nor the difference method can take interaction and non-linearity into account. \n\nCausal mediation analysis can take this into account. It can do this using a regression-based approach. It can also use other causal inference analysis methods such as g-computation, that are different from the traditional regression approach in that:\n\n- it builds a causal model. This model can include non-linearity and interactions\n- then artificially manipulate the data to set the treatment **and** the mediator to certain values\n- then predict the outcome using the causal model and contrast the outcomes\n\nAdditional approaches also exists, but we will not focus on these in this course.\n\n## Defining estimands\nImagine we have a hypothetical randomized controlled trial where we give participants treatment or no treatment on a specific outcome Y.\n\n> $Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}$\n\nFor mediation, we are also interested in the effect of a mediator on this pathway. Now image that we also intervene on the mediator in a new hypothetical randomized controlled trial.\n\n> $Y^{m=1} - Y^{m=0}$\n\nNow consider if we, in the same trial, could intervene on both because we are interested in whether treatment _causes_ the outcome because it _causes_ the mediator.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Notation\n$Y^a$ = a subject's outcome if treatment A were set, possible contrary to fact, to a\n\n$M^a$ = a subject's value of the mediator if the exposure A were set to the value of a\n\n$Y^{a,m}$ = a subject's outcome if A were set to a and M were set to m\n\n$Y^{a,M_a}$ = a subject's outcome if A were set to a and M were set the value m would have had had a been set to a. Note, this is a nested counterfactual\n:::\n\nWe can now define these estimands:\n\n- the controlled direct effect (CDE)\n- natural direct effect (NDE)\n- natural indirect effect (NIE)\n\n### Controlled direct effect\nThe effect of A on Y not mediated through M. Fixing the value of M to m.\n\n> $Y^{a=1,m}$ - $Y^{a=0,m}$\n\nWe intervene on $a$ but fix $m$ to a certain value. The CDE is how much the outcome would change on average if the mediator were fixed at level m uniformly in the population but the treatment were changed from 0 to 1. \n\nThis could be relevant in the context of a change in a policy that impacted the mediator for everyone. For instance, if air pollution was a mediator between physical activity and cardiovascular disease risk. If a new policy would change the level of air pollution for all while we implement an intervention to increase biking in the city.\n\nThis effect is not used that often. But can be highly relevant in some situations.\n\n### (Pure) Natural direct effect\n\nThe effect that would remain, if we were to disable the pathway from exposure to mediator. \n\n> $Y^{a=1,M_a=0}$ - $Y^{a=0,M_a=0}$\n\nThe PNDE is how much the outcome would change if the exposure was set at a = 1 versus a* = 0 but for each individual the mediator was kept at the level it would have taken, for that individual, in the absence of the exposure.\n\nNote that the word \"natural\" refers to the nested counterfactual, the level the mediator would have taken in the absence of exposure. What it would naturally have been in the absence of exposure. \n\n### Total natural direct effect\n\n> $Y^{a=1,M_a=1}$ - $Y^{a=0,M_a=1}$\n\nNote, different from above in that the mediator is kept at the level it would have taken in the **presence** of the exposure.\n\n### (Total) Natural indirect effect\n\nThe effect of the mediator pathway.\n\n> $Y^{a=1,M_a=1}$ - $Y^{a=1,M_a=0}$\n\nThe NIE is how much the outcome would change on average if the exposure were fixed at level a = 1 but the mediator were changed from the level it would take if a* = 0 to the level it would take if a = 1.\n\nNote that exposure has to have an effect on M otherwise this will be zero.\n\n### Pure natural indirect effect\n\n> $Y^{a=0,M_a=1}$ - $Y^{a=0,M_a=0}$\n\nNote, this is different from the TNIE in that the exposure is set to no intervention.\n\n### Interaction effects\n\nReference interaction:\n\n> $INT_{ref} = PNDE - CDE$\n\nMediation interaction:\n\n> $INT_{med} = TNIE - PNIE$\n\n### Effect decomposition\nUsing the causal inference framework also allow for effect decomposition, even when there are interaction and non-linearity.\n\nEffect decomposition is important when we want to assess relative contributions such as the proportion mediated and eliminated.\n\n> TE =  PNDE + TNIE = TNDE + PNIE\n\n### Proportions\n\nProportion CDE:\n\n> $prop^{CDE} = CDE / TE$\n\nProportion $INT_{ref}$\n\n> $prop^{INT_{ref}} = INT_{ref} / TE$\n\nProportion $INT_{med}$\n\n> $prop^{INT_{med}} = INT_{med} / TE$\n\nProportion pure natural indirect effect:\n\n> $prop^{PNIE} = PNIE / TE$\n\nProportion mediated:\n\n> $PM = TNIE / TE$\n\nProportion attributable to interaction:\n\n> $INT = (INT_{ref} + INT_{med}) / TE$\n\nProportion eliminated:\n\n> $PE = (INT_{ref} + INT_{med} + PNIE) / TE$\n\n# Study designs for causal mediation analysis\nMediation analysis can be used in both intervention and observational studies.\n\nA key assumption is that the exposure should be before the mediator and the mediator and exposure before the outcome. It is possible by design to have these three variables measured at different time points. In practice, this is rarely the case. Probably because the study was not designed to conduct mediation analysis.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Exercise: Understanding different study designs (15 min)\nStay in the same groups that you did the previous exercise.\n\n1. First discuss you own study: (5 min)\n- How does your study separate the timing between the exposure, mediator and outcome?\n- Did your study account for all the confunding assumptions? If not, why not? What could they have done?\n\n2. Everyone: (5min)\n- Describe the issues in your study to everyone.\n\n3. Everyone: (5 min)\n- How should we rank the different studies?\n- And what would be the ideal study design?\n\n:::\n\n## Two trials\n\nIt is possible to conduct two randomized controlled trials to investigate mediation (ref:Imai). One approach is the so-called parallel design. Two randomized controlled trials are conducted in parallel. The first investigates the effect of the treatment on the outcome (i.e., total effect). In the second trial we randomize both the treatment and the mediator. \n\nFor example, one could use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate if activation of specific brain regions mediate the propensity to accept more unfair monetary offers in a bidding game called the \"ultimatum game\" (ref: Knoch 2006). First, you conduct an experiment with unfair bidding and acceptance. Then one conducts the same experiment but with manipulation of the mediator, here TMS to activate a certain brain region.\n\nA key assumption here is consistency. The subjects should not know the receive the extra intervention. \n\nThere is also a crossover version (ref: Imai). Here, we first randomize the order of the treatment and control, then observe the effect on mediator and outcome. Then we assign the opposite treatment status and to the value of the mediator that was observed in the first period. \n\nIn addition to consistency there is the assumption of no carry-over effects.\n",
